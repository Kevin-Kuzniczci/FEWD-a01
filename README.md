<h1>Hello everyone! My name is Kevin Kuzniczci!  Nice to meet all of you!</h1>

<p>I am a 26 year old dude who was born in the Netherlands to American parents!  I have a bachelor's in History, with a focus on World History, and I have been to 48 U.S. states, 6 Canadian provinces, and 2 Mexican states.  I love travel, reading, video games, movie watching, art, and hanging out with friends!  My favorite places I've traveled include:</p>

<br>

<ul>
  <li>Berlin, Germany</li>
  <li>Wroclaw, Poland</li>
  <li>Southern Chinese Karsts</li>
  <li>Southern Mexico</li>
  <li>Los Angeles, California</li>
  <li>Banff National Park, British Columbia, Canada</li>
  <li>Toronto, Ontario, Canada</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>I have lived most of my life in the city of San Antonio, Texas (Go Spurs Go, always!).  In addition, I have lived on NATO bases in western Germany and southern Belgium, the suburbs of Washington D.C., attended university in Syracuse in New York State, taught ESL in the provincial capital of China's Hunan province, and a few months abroad in Wroclaw in western Poland.  I was a predominantly Mac user until 2017, where I started using Windows 7 and 10 in more depth for the sake of understanding modern computing better.  I hope to have solid grasp of web development skills sometime in the future, knowing that learning new concepts is a core part of becoming a great web developer.</p>
